Now you have the development set up and the code it's time to pick an issue to work on!

# Viewing your code in the Browser with Dev Tools

In the browser open

You can now right-click anywhere on the screen and click inspect. 
This will open the Dev Tools (for this demo we are using [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBF&ds_kid=43700010220923594&gclid=COHwovKYiN0CFQz7Gwod0UAIQA&gclsrc=ds&dclid=CKaRqfKYiN0CFUmWdwodvFcMyg) but other browsers also offer this.

# Picking your first issue

You can filter out issues by using the labels on github.
There are two important labels which are `help wanted` and `good first issue`. But you can also find other issues related to other specifications like `design` for example.
